*1. how to sort between guards, wings and bigs?*

underlying decision 1: NBA player heights and weights ARE NOT accurate // working with unreliable data so making the assumption that all recorded heights and weights are deviated by the same amount
underlying decision 2: is it better to split offense and defense?

Proposal A: input height and weight of entire NBA player pool and categorize by guard, wing and big
ad A: can determine average build for each archetype and output reasonable summary statistics to compare prospects with
disad A: sorting by guard, wing and big subjectively will add bias to data...not everyone will agree as to whether a player fits in a certain archetype (e.g Gary Harris, Robert Covington)

Proposal B: plot height and weight for entire NBA player pool and find clusters
ad B: an objective and data driven method to sort players by position
disad B1: possibility that there will be no clean clusters to sort
disad B2: players in the same build may have vastly varying skillsets (Draymond Green and Klay Thompson)

Proposal C: either of the options above, but instead of using the entire NBA player pool, only use starters
ad C1: assumption is being named a starter means a player is a relatively successful NBA player...ideally we want to compare prospects to players who have success in the NBA to determine their own chances of success
ad C2: starters have more certainty where they fall into archetypes based on their proven ability to contribute in games // no guesswork needed 
disad C: NBA starters vary even game by game
solution C: 30 teams x 5 starters per team = 150 starters in theory...take the top 5 players in minutes played for each team...even if gameplan does not call for a player to play with a certain unit, we are looking here for successful NBA players with defined roles and a large sample size

*2. how to determine prospect success?*

Proposal A: find successful sub-archetypes within positions and the stats that correlate strongly with success in those sub-archetypes (pull-up shooters for guards, two-way ability for wings, shooting for bigs)
ad A: with limited breadth of NCAA data, we can be selective in which metrics we deem important to make a best estimation as to how successful a player will be in each archetype.
disad A: much of this data may prove unneccesary and inefficient with players we KNOW cannot succeed as a certain archetype, but we measure for it anyways

Proposal B: crunch as many advanced, traditional and usage stats as possible to create a comprehensive player model
ad B: gives the measure with the most data and metrics behind it, so it should be "accurate"
disad B: this proposal should be "accurate" in theory, but introducing comprehensive information raises likelihood of introducing wasteful noise into the model
